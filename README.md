# Library Management System 

This is a collaborative project between myself and my friend. I will be working on the backend using FastAPI, while my friend will handle the frontend development.

## Project Overview

The Library Management System aims to create a robust system for managing books, users, and notifications. It also includes integration with the Google Books API to fetch book information dynamically.

This project is to hone our collaboration skills, learning new technologies, and building a real-world application. It provides an opportunity to showcase our backend and frontend development skills and create a functional Library Management System.

### Backend Development (By Me)

I will focus on the backend development, including:

- **FastAPI Usage**: Creating high-performance APIs with FastAPI.
- **Database Integration**: Configuring the database and implementing ORM with SQLAlchemy.
- **API Development**: Designing and implementing API endpoints for books, users, authentication, and notifications.

### Frontend Development (By My Friend)

My friend will handle the frontend development, including:

- **User Interface Design**: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the Library Management System.
- **API Integration**: Consuming backend APIs using JavaScript or a frontend framework like React.
- **User Experience Optimization**: Ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

### Features and Functionality

The Library Management System will include the following features:

- **Books Management**: CRUD operations for adding, updating, and deleting books.
- **User Management**: User authentication, registration, and profile management.
- **Notifications**: Sending notifications to users about book availability, due dates, fines, etc.
- **Integration with Google Books API**: Fetching book information dynamically using the Google Books API.
- **Search and Filtering**: Searching for books based on various criteria and applying filters.
- **Reservation and Waiting Lists**: Allowing users to reserve books and managing waiting lists.
- **Fine Management**: Calculating and applying fines for late returns.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generating reports on book inventory, borrowing trends, user activity, etc.




## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Configure the database settings in `app/database.py`.
4. Run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` to start the FastAPI server.
